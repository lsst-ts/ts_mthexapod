class RangedPolynomial:
    """A polynomial that is linear outside a specified range.

    This model is suitable for systems which are mostly linear, with minor
    nonlinear corrections. The idea is to prevent unrealistic values outside
    the range of values over which the polynomial coefficients were fit.

    The equation is:
    ```
    y(x) = C0 + C1 x + C2 x^2 + ...   for min_x <= x <= max_x
    y(x) = y(min_y) + C1 (x - min_x)  for x < min_x
    y(x) = y(max_x) + C1 (x - max_x)  for x > max_x
    ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    coeffs : `list` [`float`]
        Polynomial coefficients C0, C1, ...
        Must contain at least one element.
    min_x : `float`
        Minimum x below which the result is linear.
    max_x : `float`
        Maximum x above which the result is linear.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If coeffs has no elements or min_x >= max_x.
